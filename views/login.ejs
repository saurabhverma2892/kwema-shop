Before filing a claim against Kwema, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting support@Kwema.co. We'll try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting you through email.

                <p>Judicial Forum for Disputes: In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Kwema agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of Delaware. Both you and Kwema consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. We both agree to waive our right to a jury trial</p>
                <p>Limitation on Claims: Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Kwema products or Kwema Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be barred forever.</p>

                <p><b>General Terms</b></p>
                <p>Except as otherwise stated herein, these Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Kwema and you regarding the Kwema Service, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Kwema and you regarding the Kwema Service and Kwema Content. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
                <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Kwema’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Kwema may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
                <p>Any notices or other communications provided by Kwema under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Kwema Service. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt on the message will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>
                <p>Kwema’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Kwema. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p>
